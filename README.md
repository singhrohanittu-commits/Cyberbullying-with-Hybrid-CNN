# Cyberbullying-with-Hybrid-CNN
This project focuses on detecting bot-driven cyberbullying using a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Network(CNNs) with feature-enriched text processing. Cyberbullying is a growing concern in online spaces, and identifying it-especially when perpetrated by bots-requires sophisticated detection methods.
